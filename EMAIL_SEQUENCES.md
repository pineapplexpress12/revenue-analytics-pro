# Email Sequences for Revenue Analytics Pro

These email templates should be set up in your email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, Resend) with scheduled triggers based on user trial start date.

## Day 1 Email (After Install)

**Trigger:** Send immediately after initial data sync completes

**Subject:** Your data is ready! üéâ

```
Hey {name},

Your Revenue Analytics Pro dashboard is live!

We've analyzed your {company_name} data and found some interesting insights:

üéØ {at_risk_count} members are at high risk of churning
üí≥ ${failed_payment_amount} in failed payments can be recovered
üìä Your churn rate is {churn_comparison}% {better_or_worse} than average

## Day 2 Email

**Trigger:** Send 24 hours after Day 1 email

**Subject:** Did you see your cohort retention? üìä

```
{name},

One of our most powerful features is cohort retention analysis.

It shows which signup months have the best retention rates for {company_name}.

This helps you:
‚Ä¢ Identify what's working (and when)
‚Ä¢ Predict future churn patterns
‚Ä¢ Time promotions strategically
‚Ä¢ Optimize your member acquisition

Check Your Cohorts ‚Üí

Pro tip: Look for months with 90%+ retention at month 3. Those are your golden cohorts. Try to replicate what made them successful.

## Implementation Notes

### Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended for MVP)
1. **Use a tool like Loops.so, Customer.io, or Resend**
2. **Trigger emails manually or via webhook** when user installs app
3. **Store trial start date** in database
4. **Use scheduled jobs** to send emails at correct intervals

### Option 2: Automated with Vercel Cron (Future)
Create API routes that run on cron schedule:
- `/api/cron/send-day1-emails` - Runs hourly, checks for new users
- `/api/cron/send-day2-emails` - Runs daily, sends to users at day 2
- `/api/cron/send-day3-emails` - Runs daily, sends to users at day 3

### Email Service Providers

**Recommended (Free tier available):**
- **Resend** - Developer-friendly, 3k emails/month free
- **Loops.so** - Built for SaaS, visual editor
- **SendGrid** - 100 emails/day free

**Template Variables to Track:**
Store these in your database when user installs:
```typescript
{
  userId: string;
  companyId: string;
  trialStartDate: Date;
  emailsSent: {
    day1: Date | null;
    day2: Date | null;
    day3: Date | null;
  }
}
```

### Rate Limiting
- Don't send more than 1 email per day per user
- Check `emailsSent` timestamps before sending
- Handle bounces and unsubscribes
